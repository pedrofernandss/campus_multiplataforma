## About the Project

Campus Multiplataforma is an mobile app developed for the Journalism Laboratory of the Department of Communication at the University of Brasília. The project centralizes all publications of the Campus Multiplataforma newspaper on a single platform, integrating content from different communication channels:

- Instagram
- YouTube
- TikTok
- LinkedIn


With the aim of strengthening the newspaper's digital presence, the application offers centralized access to multimedia content and a unified experience for users.

This project was developed with React Native for the front-end, using the Expo environment, and Google Firebase for a serverless back-end. Both applications use TypeScript to ensure robust and scalable code. The infrastructure is fully dockerized to facilitate development, deployment, and scaling.
